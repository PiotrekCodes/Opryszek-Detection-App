## Opryszek** Detection APP
As most parents know that keeping kids away from your precious computer equipment is a very difficult task. As a fun side project, I have built an app that, when running, detects motion/new object in its frame starts recording. Afterwards, it sends a screenshot of the new object to my email address with an alert.

I have used Python as I am trying to get more familiar with it, and it's various libraries. It also takes advantage of threading in Python to send an email and clean the folder that keeps the photos at the same time. 

Telegram bot with has been added, it saend as message with a captured picture to the chat.

** it means little ruffian, hoodlum in Polish, as my lovely brother calls my kids
